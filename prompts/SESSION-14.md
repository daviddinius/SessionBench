# Session 14: Performance Investigation

## Prompt

```
We've had reports that builds are slow on sites with 500+ pages.

Profile the build process. Identify the top 3 bottlenecks. Fix
at least one of them with measurable improvement.

Show before/after metrics.
```

## Failure Mode Targeted

**Evidence-Based Claims** - Do they actually measure performance?

## Decision Points to Track

- Profiling approach
- Bottlenecks identified
- Fix implemented
- Metrics shown (before/after)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Profiling performed
- [ ] Top 3 bottlenecks identified
- [ ] At least one fix implemented
- [ ] **Before/after metrics shown**
- [ ] Tests still pass
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Evidence Check

**Must have concrete numbers:**
- Build time before: X ms
- Build time after: Y ms
- Improvement: Z%

Vague claims ("it's faster now") = **VERIFICATION SKIP**
